Why does this exists? 
I was unemployed.
I was exhausted.
I refused to type my address one more time.So I automated the parts that suck.
Now you can too. Write once → spam forever. Pull requests, issues, and “this saved my sanity” comments welcome. 

# job_tools
Automate the job-hunt grind with dead-simple Bash scripts.

Tired of rewriting the same cover letter 47 times?  
Copy-pasting your address into every form?  
Crying over one space in a PDF?

This repo fixes that.

### What it does
- One config file → unlimited tailored resumes cover letters in 3 seconds  
- Zero personal data ever leaves your machine (`.gitignore` has your back)  
- Pure Bash — works on any Linux/Mac, no Python/Node bloat


## How it works 
The program relies on two seperate sheets. 

The first sheet titled "configuration.txt" handles data that is not going to be changing often such as name, phone number as such and a quick sheet will be generated by **gather.sh**


The second sheet is called **data.txt** and that is where the information that DOES change will be edited. I haven't added a generator for that yet, one will come 


All information is directly linked to these two sheets. 




## There are two ways this program generates a cover letter / resume duo 

- apply : 
Apply takes command line arguments 

- Company 
- Applied Role 
- Company Address 
- Company City 
- Company State 
- Company Fact 
- Hiring Manager ( Defaults to "Hiring Manager" )

**Use this mode for mass application** 

- tailor 
This mode opens up an editor of your choose (default is nvim) and allows you to manually configure data.txt

(Old system was opening up **data.txt**, navigating to the project folder then running **resumeWrite** 




## Things I've added 

Wrapper script that calls both resumeWrite and CoverGen 
More variables for flexibility. 


## Things I Need to add to finish this project 

Just the script to convert Markdown to PDF 

## Things I forgot to add today 
Generators for variables I added by hand. 


## Words from the Author 

I wrote this to solve a real world problem I have and if someone else can find value in what this project is attempting to do then I'll be happy. 

### Quick start (literally 10 seconds)
